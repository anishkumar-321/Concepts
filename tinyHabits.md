# Tiny Habits

## 1.In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most interesting part of the video is about BJ Fogg and how he improved his fitness using tiny habits. He started by doing just two push-ups after each bathroom break. Gradually, he increased the number of push-ups, which helped him reach his fitness goals without needing much motivation or willpower.


## 2.How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

### B=MAP Formula

**Symbol** | **What It Means**  
**B**      | Behavior (the habit you want to build)  
**M**      | Motivation (your desire to do it)  
**A**      | Ability (how easy it is to do)  
**P**      | Prompt (a reminder to do it)  


## 3.Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)


Celebrating after completing a habit is important because it makes you feel good about what you've done. This positive feeling encourages your brain to repeat the habit. Simply put, whatever you celebrate, you’re more likely to keep doing. By celebrating, you help turn the action into a regular habit.

### Identity in *Atomic Habits* vs. James Clear's Video

  **Book:** *Atomic Habits*  
   **Focus**: Doesn’t emphasize identity much.

  **Video**: "1% Better Every Day" by James Clear  
   **Focus**: Identity is key.  
   **Main Idea**: Real change happens when you change who you are, not just by reaching goals.  
   **Suggestion**: Aim to become the kind of person who naturally achieves what you want.  
   **Benefit**: This approach leads to more lasting and effective changes.

## 5.What is the book's perspective about Identity?

According to the video, the book says true change comes from changing your identity. This means instead of just setting goals, you should focus on becoming the type of person who achieves those goals. For example, if you want to be healthy, you'd focus on habits that make you a healthy person, like eating well and exercising.

## 6.Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

The book *Atomic Habits* provides a perspective on how to make a habit easier to do:

1. **Make it Obvious:**  
   Design your environment to provide cues for good habits.

2. **Make it Attractive:**  
   Associate the habit with something enjoyable or rewarding.

3. **Make it Easy:**  
   Reduce friction and create a favorable environment for the habit.

4. **Make it Satisfying:**  
   Attach immediate gratification to reinforce the habit.

5. **Celebrate Small Wins:**  
   Acknowledge and reward progress to maintain motivation.

### How to Make Bad Habits Harder to Do

The book suggests making bad habits harder to follow by:

1. **Making Them Invisible:**  
   Remove things that remind you of the bad habit.

2. **Making Them Unattractive:**  
   Associate the habit with negative feelings.

3. **Making Them Difficult:**  
   Increase the effort needed to do the bad habit.

4. **Making Them Unsatisfying:**  
   Remove any immediate rewards from the habit.

By making bad habits less appealing and more challenging, you can reduce how often they happen and their impact on your life. Remember, small changes can lead to big improvements over time.


## 8.Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

### Habit: Exercising Regularly

To make exercising a regular habit, follow these key steps:

1. ### Make It Easy and Attractive
    **Prepare:** Lay out workout clothes the night before and keep equipment accessible.
    **Enjoy:** Explore different routines, create a motivating playlist, and start with low-impact exercises. Reward yourself after each workout.

2. ### Make It Obvious and Satisfying
    **Plan:** Schedule workouts in your calendar and find a workout buddy for accountability.
    **Track:** Monitor your progress, celebrate small victories, and focus on how good you feel after each workout.

## 9.Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

To reduce overthinking, I'll make it less appealing by linking it to stress and anxiety. I'll also make it harder by setting time limits on how long I think about things. To make it less satisfying, I'll stop focusing on negative outcomes and instead focus on taking action. I'll remind myself that overthinking doesn't solve problems and that taking steps forward is more productive. Small actions will help break the cycle of overthinking and build better habits.
