# Introduction

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern organizes applications into three distinct parts:

- **Model**: Manages data and business logic.
- **View**: Displays data to the user.
- **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary, handling user input, updating the Model, and refreshing the View.

## MVC Components

- **Model**: Handles data and application rules.

- **View**: Renders data in a user-friendly format.

- **Controller**: Interacts with both the Model and View, processing user inputs and updates.

## Spring Framework

The Spring Framework simplifies Java application development with several key features:

- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Manages object creation and dependencies, promoting cleaner and more testable code.

- **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)**: Separates cross-cutting concerns (like logging) from the core business logic.

- **Spring MVC**: Implements the MVC pattern for web applications.

## Spring MVC Features

- **Annotation-Based Configuration**: Uses annotations such as Controller to simplify setup.

- **RESTful Web Services**: Facilitates API development with annotations like RestController.

- **View Technology Integration**: Supports various technologies including JSP, Thymeleaf, and FreeMarker.

## Conclusion

The MVC pattern, coupled with the Spring Framework, provides a solid foundation for creating scalable and maintainable applications. It helps keep code organized and improves development efficiency.
